# Read-Me-Generator
# Description
    For this project we were asked to create a read me generator that when presented with a number of prompts would input the user's data into a read me file.
# Javascript/jQuery
    START PROMPT
    The first thing we needed to do was set up the prompt questions that would be asked of the user. Including title, description, installation, usage, collaborators, tests, questions, and licenses.
    GENERATE READ ME
    Once this was completed we needed to write out a readme format to input the data into. This had to be done in Markdown Script
    After the file was all wireframed we then had to add in the specific information to the file from our prompted questions. This would create the answers for the readMe.
    Then we needed an async function that would run after the prompted questions were asked and fill in the data to a read me file when completed.
